	<p>ExtraRelaTable is a thesis project developed by VÃ¡clav Brodec at
		Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of Charles University in Prague,
		which applies bottom-up approach to assignment of RDF properties to
		numeric table columns; these properties identify the relations formed
		between the columns and the subject of the table. The project follows
		and complements preceding work of Neumaier et al., which uses more
		general top-down approach to labeling of numeric columns.</p>

	<p>
		The algorithm is exposed through public REST API at <a
			href="http://localhost:8080/extrarelatable/">http://localhost:8080/extrarelatable/</a>,
		supposed that the packaged WAR is deployed in a local servlet
		container on default port. ERT may optionally use available running
		instance of Odalic STI tool (<a href="https://github.com/odalic">https://github.com/odalic</a>)
		to provide additional context, which increases the effectiveness of
		the algorithm.
	</p>

	<p>Alongside the main application, a small experimental framework
		is included, implemented as a set of JUnit tests, which allow to
		thoroughly evaluate the algorithm on various supported data sets.</p>

	<p>
		The project is documented in the accompanying thesis Discovering and
		Creating Relations among CSV Columns using Linked Data Knowledge
		Bases. The sources are hosted at <a
